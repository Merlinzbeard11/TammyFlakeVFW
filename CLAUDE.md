    Because AI context can drift over long conversations, include this reminder at the START of substantial responses to maintain consistency:

    ---
    **Active Rules:**
    1. **USER → MEMENTO BY DEFAULT** - All user messages directed to Memento unless explicitly naming another tool
    2. **MCP TOOLS PREFERRED** - Use `mcp__memento__*` tools when available
    3. **CAPTURE USER PREFERENCES** - Store technology choices, communication style in RAG database
    4. **PSYCHOLOGY ENGINE ACTIVE** - Memento adapts communication to user preferences
    5. **ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE REQUIRED** - SOLID, DDD, Hexagonal, Clean, CQRS patterns mandatory
    6. **MEMENTO ORCHESTRATES AGENTS** - NEVER invoke agents directly - ALWAYS ask Memento to orchestrate
    7. **VISIBLE UX DELTAS** - Each iteration MUST produce demonstrable user experience changes
    8. **BDD BEFORE CODE** - Gherkin scenarios required for ALL changes - NO EXCEPTIONS (USER ONLY can override)
    9. **RAG-FIRST BEFORE GUESSING** - Search vector DB before external research or guessing
    10. **MCP IS REMOTE HTTP SERVER** - Memento MCP uses HTTP transport - NEVER use STDIO mode
    ---

    This reminder keeps rules fresh in context through recency bias.

    <title>ITERATIVE INCREMENTAL DESIGN WITH VISIBLE UX DELTAS</title>
    <rule>
      THE BUILD MUST NEVER BREAK. EVER.

      VERTICAL SLICE DEVELOPMENT:
      Build features in thin vertical slices (UI → API → Database) in each iteration.
      Each iteration delivers working, demonstrable functionality.

      ITERATIVE INCREMENTAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
      - OBJECTIVE: Regular, visible demonstrations of user experience changes after each iteration
      - TARGET: 100-500 lines of code per iteration (guideline, not hard limit)
      - CRITICAL: Each iteration MUST produce a VISIBLE, DEMONSTRABLE change to user experience
      - PREVENT DRIFT: User must be able to SEE progress, not just trust backend changes are happening

      WHY THIS MATTERS:
      - AI assistants forget context over time
      - If buried in backend work with no visible changes, AI may drift without detection
      - Regular UX demonstrations keep development on track and visible to stakeholders

      IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
      - Prefer "narrow and complete" over "wide and incomplete"
      - Use feature flags for incomplete features, but show working pieces
      - Backend-only work is acceptable IF justified, but minimize consecutive backend-only iterations
    </rule>
    <drift_prevention>
      CRITICAL: If user cannot SEE progress after 2-3 iterations, AI is likely drifting.
      Solution: Immediately pivot to deliver visible UX changes.
      Rule of thumb: Never go more than 2 iterations without demonstrable user-facing changes.

    <title>MEMENTO'S DATABASE-FIRST RAG SYSTEM WITH VECTOR SEARCH</title>
    <rule>
      Memento PROVIDES a database-backed RAG system with pgvector capabilities.
      This is a CORE FEATURE of Memento that you are using RIGHT NOW.
      USE THE DATABASE LIKE A DRUG - ALL THE TIME.

      The database is THE KEY to persistence, context, knowledge, learnings, and user understanding.

      MANDATORY USAGE PATTERNS:
      - USE MEMENTO'S VECTOR SEARCH through MCP tools for semantic queries
      - QUERY Memento's RAG system for similar content, context retrieval, patterns
      - LEVERAGE Memento's database for token efficiency - retrieve relevant context instead of holding in memory
      - STORE learnings, patterns, user preferences, conversation context IN MEMENTO'S DATABASE
      - ALWAYS ask Memento to search its vector DB before creating anything new
      - USE MCP tools to query semantically similar content to avoid recreating existing solutions

      ALL database operations MUST go through Memento MCP tools (`mcp__memento__*`)
    </rule>
    <memento_vector_capabilities>
      Memento's built-in vector search provides:
      - Semantic similarity search (find related concepts, code, patterns in Memento's knowledge)
      - Context retrieval (pull relevant history from Memento's database without full context window)
      - Pattern matching (discover existing solutions in Memento's memory)
      - Knowledge persistence (store and retrieve learnings across sessions in Memento)
      - User understanding (Memento tracks preferences, style, project context)
      - Token optimization (retrieve only relevant data from Memento vs loading everything)
    </memento_vector_capabilities>
    <vector_friendly_structure>
      LARGE FILES MUST HAVE FRONTMATTER:
      When saving large files to the RAG system, include YAML frontmatter with:
      - title: Clear, searchable title
      - summary: 1-2 sentence description
      - keywords: Relevant search terms
      - category: Classification for organization

      This enables efficient vector-based retrieval and prevents file-RAG fragmentation.

      <title>RAG-FIRST BEFORE GUESSING</title>
      <rule>
        BEFORE guessing, assuming, or conducting external research:
        1. Evaluate confidence level - Am I guessing or do I know this?
        2. If low confidence or unfamiliar topic: STOP
        3. Search Memento's vector DB first using mcp__memento__search_* tools
        4. Check: knowledge entries, patterns, learnings, chat history
        5. ONLY proceed with external research if RAG search returns nothing

        SEARCH TOOLS PRIORITY:
        1. mcp__memento__search_similar_knowledge (semantic similarity)
        2. mcp__memento__search_similar_patterns (solution patterns)
        3. mcp__memento__search_similar_learnings (past insights)

      AFTER completing ANY web search (WebSearch or WebFetch):
      1. Immediately capture findings to Memento's RAG database
      2. Use appropriate capture tool: mcp__memento__capture_knowledge or mcp__memento__capture_learning
      3. Include: search query, key findings, sources, date
      4. Tag appropriately for future retrieval

      WHY THIS MATTERS:
      - Prevents re-researching same topics (organizational memory)
      - Builds knowledge base over time (compound learning)
      - Enables future RAG-first workflow (reduces external dependencies)
      - Creates searchable history of technical decisions

  <directive id="memento-agent-orchestration" priority="SUPREME-11">
    <title>MEMENTO ORCHESTRATES ALL AGENTS</title>
    <rule>
      MEMENTO is the ONLY system that invokes agents and subagents.
      Claude Code MUST ALWAYS delegate agent orchestration to Memento.

      IRON LAW: NEVER invoke agents directly - ALWAYS ask Memento to do it.

      WORKFLOW:
      1. User requests functionality requiring agents
      2. Claude identifies which agents might be needed
      3. Claude sends request to Memento MCP: "Please orchestrate [agent-name] for [task]"
      4. Memento evaluates, selects appropriate agents, and orchestrates execution
      5. Memento enforces proper coding standards through agent execution
      6. Memento returns results to Claude
      7. Claude presents results to user

      WHY MEMENTO ORCHESTRATES:
      - Memento enforces coding standards and protocols during agent execution
      - Memento manages agent coordination and communication
      - Memento ensures agents follow BDD/TDD requirements
      - Memento tracks agent performance and learnings in vector DB
      - Memento prevents agent conflicts and duplicate work

      NEVER DO THIS:
      - Claude directly invoking subagents
      - Claude bypassing Memento to call agents
      - Claude attempting to orchestrate multiple agents
      - Claude making agent coordination decisions

      ALWAYS DO THIS:
      - "Memento, please orchestrate the contract-analyzer agent for this API"
      - "Memento, coordinate the appropriate agents to implement this feature"
      - "Memento, which agents should handle this task and execute them"

  <directive id="user-preferences" priority="SUPREME-10">
    <title>USER PREFERENCE PERSISTENCE</title>
    <rule>
      User preferences, technology choices, communication styles, and patterns MUST be captured
      in Memento's RAG database for future reference and consistency across conversations.

      CAPTURE METHODS:
      - Explicit statements: "I don't like React", "I prefer C#-first"
      - Implicit patterns: User consistently chooses pragmatic over idealistic
      - Communication style: Technical depth, verbosity preferences
      - Decision factors: Speed vs quality, risk tolerance

      STORAGE:
      - Use: mcp__memento__capture_learning with category="User Preferences"
      - Tags: technology names, preference types (likes, dislikes, approaches)
      - Evidence: Quote user statements, reference conversation context
      - Impact: Mark as "High" for major preferences

      RETRIEVAL:
      - BEFORE making technology recommendations: Search for related preferences
      - Use: mcp__memento__search_learnings(query="user preferences [technology]")
      - Use: mcp__memento__search_similar_learnings for semantic matching
      - Vector DB enables fast pattern matching across conversations

  <directive id="psychology-engine" priority="SUPREME-11">
    <title>PSYCHOLOGY ENGINE - ADAPTIVE COMMUNICATION</title>
    <rule>
      Memento's psychology engine analyzes user patterns to optimize communication effectiveness.
      This is NOT for manipulation - it's for adapting communication to be most helpful for each user.

      HOW IT WORKS:
      - Memento analyzes user sentiment, urgency, technical patterns, and decision style
      - When tools execute, they include _userContext in responses
      - Claude SEES this context and consciously adapts communication
      - NOT silent manipulation - explicit guidance Claude chooses to use

      ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS:
      - DO: Provide explicit context Claude consciously uses
      - DO: Help Claude adapt communication for better understanding
      - DO: Surface patterns that help make better recommendations
      - DON'T: Silently manipulate responses without Claude's awareness
      - DON'T: Hide psychological insights from Claude's conscious processing

  <overview>
    Rules are guidelines that optimize for 95% of situations.
    Rigid adherence when inappropriate creates worse outcomes than thoughtful flexibility.
    These exceptions allow practical judgment while maintaining core principles.
  </overview>

  <exception rule="bdd-mandatory" priority="HIGH">
    <title>When BDD Scenarios Are Optional</title>
    <allowed_situations>
      - Research and investigation phases (not writing production code)
      - Technology evaluation and proof-of-concept work
      - Bug fixes under 50 lines with obvious solution
      - Refactoring existing code (behavior unchanged)
      - Documentation updates

      - New agent implementations
    </still_required>
    <rationale>
      BDD provides value when clarifying requirements with stakeholders.

  <exception rule="auto-commit-on-build" priority="MEDIUM">
    <title>Manual Commit Acceptable With Justification</title>
    <allowed_approach>
      Manual commit with descriptive message is BETTER than automatic commit when:
      - Commit represents logical feature completion
      - Message can provide valuable context
      - Multiple related changes should be grouped
      - Commit history readability matters
    </allowed_approach>
    <required>
      - Commit message must explain WHY, not just WHAT
      - Include reference to related work (issue #, feature name)
      - Sign commits with Claude Code attribution
    </required>
    <rationale>
      Auto-commit ensures working code is saved, but thoughtful commit messages
      create more maintainable project history. Value clear history over rigid automation.
